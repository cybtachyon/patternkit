## Prerequisites

### Drupal
Patternkit is first and foremost a Drupal module. See the [Getting Involved Guide](https://www.drupal.org/contribute/development) for a step-by-step for contributing to Drupal.

### Patterns & Components
It's important to understand how patterns and components relate to each other and to Drupal.

See the [README](README.md#definitions) for basic definitions.

### The Patternkit Ecosystem

There are several moving parts in the Patternkit ecosystem:

 - **patternkit** This module! See [README.MD](README.md)
 - **[patternkit_media_library](modules/patternkit_media_library)** Provides media_library integration for drupal_image schema properties.
 - **[patternkit_example](modules/patternkit_example)** An example module providing a pattern library.
 - **[patternkit_env](https://github.com/drupal-pattern-lab/patternkit_env)** A customized development environment meant to make it easier to contribute to Patternkit.
 - **[patternfly_theme](https://github.com/drupal-pattern-lab/patternfly_theme)** PatternFly is an open source design system oriented around modern user interfaces. This theme is custom-built to provide a clean and consistent Drupal experience, and as a bonus ships with Patternkit-compatible pattern schema by default.
 - **[pattern lab](https://patternlab.io/)** PatternLab provides a development environment for creating pattern and component libraries. It also has a branch for providing a rendering REST server that Patternkit can use to provide scalable server-side rendering of dynamic templates with low cacheability.

### Code Architecture Philosophy

Patternkit was written with this philosophy in mind: _"What is the simplest way to solve the problem of mapping back-end data to front-end patterns for non-developers?"_
Considering the answer we arrived at was "refactor how the Drupal Core Library system works", it seems like that is a rather complicated problem!

### Patternkit Entry Points and Classes

Drupal documents functionality through change records, which you can search at [https://www.drupal.org/list-changes/drupal](https://www.drupal.org/list-changes/drupal).

While most Patternkit files are self-explanatory, the main entry points and important classes of Patternkit are written here:

 - **[patternkit.services.yml](patternkit.services.yml)** Provides the suite of Patternkit services to Drupal. This is the primary entry point for most of Patternkit's functionality.
 - **[package.json](package.json)** Patternkit relies on third-party libraries to provide functionality for things like the JSON Schema editor. This entry point provides several node.js scripts for maintaining, upgrading, and building those libraries as well as Patternkit's Drupal JS.
 - **[PatternLibraryDiscovery](src/PatternkitLibraryDiscovery.php)**
 - **[PatternLibraryLoader](src/Loader/PatternLibraryLoader.php)** This is the loader for Twig that provides namespace functionality and loading for theme patterns.

## How Can I Contribute?
### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report :pencil:, reproduce the behavior :computer: :computer:, and find related reports :mag_right:.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

* **Perform a [cursory search](https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/patternkit?categories=All)** to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [Drupal.org issues](https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/patternkit?categories=All).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you installed Patternkit, e.g. which command exactly you used in the terminal. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**. For example, if you moved the cursor to the end of a line, explain if you used the mouse, or a keyboard shortcut, and if so which one?
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux.
* **If you're reporting that Patternkit crashed**, include a crash report with a stack trace from the operating system. On macOS, the crash report will be available in `Console.app` under "Diagnostic and usage information" > "User diagnostic reports". Include the crash report in the issue in a <pre><code> block, an attachment, or put it in a [gist](https://gist.github.com/) and provide link to that gist.
* **If the problem is related to performance or memory**, include a [profile capture](https://blackfire.io/) with your report.
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.

Provide more context by answering these questions:

* **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating to a new version) or was this always a problem?
* If the problem started happening recently, **can you reproduce the problem in an older version?** What's the most recent version in which the problem doesn't happen? You can download older versions of Patternkit from [the releases page](https://www.drupal.org/project/patternkit/releases).
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.
* If the problem is related to working with files (e.g. opening and editing files), **does the problem happen for all files and projects or only some?** Does the problem happen only when working with local or remote files (e.g. on network drives), with files of a specific type (e.g. only JavaScript or Python files), with large files or files with very long lines, or with files in a specific encoding? Is there anything else special about the files you are using?

Include details about your configuration and environment:

* **Which version are you using?**
* **What's the name and version of the OS you're using**?
* **Which Drupal modules do you have installed?** You can get that list by running `drush pm-list`.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion :pencil: and find related suggestions :mag_right:.

Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check [this list](#before-submitting-an-enhancement-suggestion) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating an enhancement suggestion, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion). Include the steps that you imagine you would take if the feature you're requesting existed.

#### Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion

* **Check if there's already [a module](https://drupal.org/project/modules) which provides that enhancement.**
* **Perform a [cursory search](https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/patternkit?categories=All)** to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [Drupal.org issues](https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/patternkit?categories=All). Create an issue and provide the following information:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, as <code> blocks.
* **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related to. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux.
* **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most users and isn't something that can or should be implemented as another module.
* **List some other text editors or applications where this enhancement exists.**
* **Specify which version you're using.**
* **Specify the name and version of the OS you're using.**
